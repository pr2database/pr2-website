Originally from Luxembourg, I completed my undergrad degree in Biological Sciences at the University of Namur (Belgium), with a focus in Ecology. Currently part of the MEME programme in Evolutionary Biology, I spent my first year at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) and at the University of Montpellier (France). My general interests revolve around evolution and diversity in changing environments. While a previous project focused on the evolution of phenotypic plasticity in response to randomly fluctuating environments, I am currently shifting focus to larger timescales, especially on how environmental change affects species distribution and adaptation. An interest in protists came from realizing that they have been a connecting thread for me across these topics.

Finally, moving across Europe allows me to pursue two of my other interests: choir-singing and learning new languages.
