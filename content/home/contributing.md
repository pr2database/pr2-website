You can contribute to the PR<sup>2</sup> database in different ways.  

* The [EukRef]({{< ref "/eukref/about.md" >}}) project has developed pipelines to obtain sequences from a given phylogenetic group. It organizes  [workshops]({{< ref "/eukref/workshop_roscoff.md" >}}) focused on specific groups (more information soon on up-coming workshops).
* You can also provide expert annotation or metadata for a taxonomic which you have analyzed in the framework of your thesis or a specific project.  See [detailed instructions here]({{< ref "/documentation/pr2-annotation-simple.md">}}).
