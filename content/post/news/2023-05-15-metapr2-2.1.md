title: 'metaPR2 version 2.1.0'

To finalize the update of the different interconnected PR2 databases, we are very pleased to announce version 2.1.0 of the [metapr2](https://app.metapr2.org/) database. 

This version contains the same set of samples and metabarcodes (ASVs) than metapr2 version 2.0 but ASVs are now assigned with [PR2 database version 5.0.0](https://app.pr2-database.org) that implements a [new taxonomy structure](https://pr2-database.org/documentation/pr2-taxonomy-9-levels/) with 9 levels instead of 8.
