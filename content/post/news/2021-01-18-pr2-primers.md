We are very pleased to announce the new [PR<sup>2</sup> primer database](https://app.pr2-primers.org/).

We built a database listing about 180 primers and 80 primer pairs that have been used for eukaryotic 18S rRNA metabarcoding. Performance of primer pairs was tested against two sequence databases: PR2 for eukaryotes and a subset of Silva for prokaryotes. This allowed to determine the taxonomic specificity of primer pairs, the location of mismatches as well as amplicon size. We developed a R-based web application that allows to browse the database, visualize the taxonomic distribution of the amplified sequences with the number of mismatches, and to test any user-defined primer set.
